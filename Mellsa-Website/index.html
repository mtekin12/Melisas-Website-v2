            <div id="body-text"> On a Fence was done as part of Paths to Pier 42, a pop-up park on the Lower East Side waterfront. The project transforms the fence surrounding the park into an interactive structure that incorporates color and signage on the outside, and seating and play areas on the inside. The project inverts the function and meaning of the fence from a physical barrier to a place of inclusion. Through workshops, meetings, and volunteer opportunities, we engaged with a number of local residents to design and build the work.</div>

            <div id="body-text">Civic Action is an effort by the Noguchi Museum and Sculpture Park to expand the dialogue around recent developments in their local Long Island City neighborhood. Four artists known for their work in the public sphere were invited to form individual teams with architect or planners to conceive of artistic, environmental, and policy-based solutions for preserving the livability of Long Island City.</div>

            <div id="body-text">The concept uses layered plywood to allude to the vertical patterns produced by books on a bookshelf, creating multiple visual effects based on the angle one views the library. located in a diverse community made up of english, spanish, and chinese speakers, this visual effect allows the book shelter to convey the word ‘library’ (printed on the surface of the piece) in these three languages all at once. in addition, the communal intervention provides two linear feet of bookshelf space;  including seating that faces the east river waterfront providing a space where people can stay to read, share with their neighbors, and enjoy the view.</div>
